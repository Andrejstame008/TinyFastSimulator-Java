- **Queueing Models**: Analyze queue behavior with G/G/c models.
- **Benchmarking Tools**: Evaluate performance and efficiency of your simulations.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Designed for ease of use, even for beginners.
- **Extensible Architecture**: Add custom components and models as needed.

## Getting Started

To get started with TinyFastSimulator-Java, download the latest version from our [Releases section](https://github.com/Andrejstame008/TinyFastSimulator-Java/releases). Follow the instructions to set up your environment.

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- Basic understanding of Java programming
- Familiarity with discrete event simulation concepts

## Usage

After downloading and executing the application, you can start creating your simulations. The simulator allows you to define events, resources, and queues. Hereâ€™s a brief overview of how to use the simulator:

1. **Define Your Model**: Specify the parameters of your G/G/c model, including arrival rates, service times, and the number of servers.
2. **Run Simulations**: Execute your model and observe the results.
3. **Analyze Results**: Use built-in tools to analyze performance metrics such as average wait times and system utilization.

## Key Concepts

### Discrete Event Simulation

Discrete event simulation (DES) is a method for modeling the operation of a system as a discrete sequence of events in time. In TinyFastSimulator, you can define events that trigger changes in the state of your system.

### Queueing Theory

Queueing theory studies how entities wait in line. In our simulator, you can model various queueing scenarios to understand system performance under different conditions.

### G/G/c Models

G/G/c models are a class of queueing models where both the arrival and service processes are governed by general distributions. This flexibility allows for realistic modeling of many real-world systems.

## Installation

1. Download the latest release from the [Releases section](https://github.com/Andrejstame008/TinyFastSimulator-Java/releases).
2. Unzip the downloaded file to your preferred location.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt.
4. Navigate to the directory where you unzipped the files.
5. Execute the simulator using the command:

   ```bash
   java -jar TinyFastSimulator.jar
   ```

## Examples

Here are a few examples to illustrate how to use TinyFastSimulator:

### Example 1: Basic Queueing Model

1. Define arrival and service rates.
2. Set the number of servers.
3. Run the simulation.
4. Review the output for average wait times and system utilization.

### Example 2: Complex System

1. Create multiple queues with different parameters.
2. Introduce events that affect multiple queues.
3. Analyze how changes impact overall system performance.
